I am a master's student in Electronic Science and Technology at Beijing University of Technology, expecting to graduate in June 2026. My research interests lie in Computer Vision and Vision-Language-Action models.

I am currently a VLA algorithm intern at Li Auto, where I am researching the cutting-edge modeling methods and model structures of VLA (Vision-Language-Action) models, and exploring the application of active vision in models.

Previously, I worked on robotic arm deployment at Westlake University, where I assisted in building a data collection system for the Franka robotic arm and developing the model deployment interface.
